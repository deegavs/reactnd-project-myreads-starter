# MyReads Project

## Desscription

This is a student assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The project comes with a starter package template but without any of the React code that is needed to complete the project. Our requirement is to add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in the starter template.

## Launching the App

Clone the repository install the dependencies before running the app. Run `npm install` to download dependencies. Run `npm start or yarn start` to launch the app on a local server `http://localhost:3000.`

## Dependencies 

For a better user interactivity, the application uses [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom) to listen to changes and manage those changes in the url and update the right components.
To install it run `npm install --save react-router-dom`

## Issues
The page has a bug with the `Search component` but has now been solved.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

This repository is an assesment project and for my later reference, I therefore most likely will not accept pull requests.
